# State Of Life: 2023
First blog of 2023! I published an astounding 3 blogs in 2022 :D I write a lot, but I rarely publish.

But anyhow, I think that I'll continue doing what I do without regards to anything or anyone else's opinions,
so I'll try to write more this year simply because I want to.

In reality I wanted to publish this blog with a new version of my personal website that I've been working on,
(It's entirely different and built from scratch), but I have a lot of plans nowadays, so maybe later.

This is the year of art and exploration, I want to further explore my music, game development, writing, 
and exploration of the world in general.

I want to write about it and share, because sharing is caring...

Anyhow, to not completely transition into a new world without any context, I should prolly write about last year.
It was an interesting year, personally speaking of course. I'm sure it was interesting to lots of people as well.
I believe that I have found a good way to deal with the current states of the "world".

## Art & Catharsis
Catharsis of emotions, observing yourself observing your own thoughts so you can think of the best solutions to
deal with certain thoughts and certain emotions, identifying which ones are best to simply let be or accept, etc...

Afterwards, what works for me is transducing them into something more physical, be it a track or a drawing, or
a physical representation; this way I can store them physically and it does feels like I've purged it.

Creating sounds is a good way of doing this, especially when it's very physical with analog synths, instruments
such as the Flute or Guitar (or others, those are just my preferred ones at the moment)...

I distance myself a lot from media, except where it contains people that I enjoy on a more personal level. I couldn't care less about any
other, and that's a choice that I've made very early on. Media and socials can obviously be quite hellish; but on the flipside it does
become quite comical to observe when you have a certain mindset.

I'm not a nihilist, I have quite a lot of hope; I believe in the struggle of finding hope and love,
maybe I'm just too young to give up, but I believe that when things
get really difficult you should just drop everything and look deep into nature for a bit. Maybe I'm fortunate to have
chosen this path early on, I've structured life in a way where I can do this without any major impact, but I wouldn't
really care if others' dissaproval becomes persistent, others being people, or even the government prohibiting something.

I don't feel like writing too much about past stuff, this is why I always drop my writings that I've written, because I
spend too much time on them and with time, I change.

So as far as looking back, I think this is where it ends!

I will be focusing a lot on my own artistic projects this year; music, game development, art in general, etc. It's what
I will leave behind after all.

## Crypto & Government
People always look for the "next big thing", something they can be early on so they make money! I don't give a shit, honestly
I **really** hate money. Not because it isn't a useful concept or tool, but I hate it because of the effect it has on some people.

This doesn't mean that it isn't important, it is very important, and it *can* very much aid you in being happy, but only to a certain
extent.

What makes crypto so important for me is literally what it started out as; a way to transfer assets in a **trustless** manner to anywhere
and anyone in the world; a system where it becomes hard for a singular entity to censor or prohibit a transaction. **Sharing, is Caring.**

Please, if you instantly start thinking "but criminals!1!!1", look around a bit more; as long as there is supply there will be demand.
Stop crime at the roots, and not by taking away means, because "they" will find other means. The positive effects of decentralized,
permissionless and trustless transfer of funds far, far outweigh the negative. But of course, anything that can potentially transfer the power
away from the currently powerful will become an enemy of the currently powerful.

And be it as it may, a lot of things labled as crime **I** believe shouldn't be. And this varies a lot depending on which country you live in.

In some countries you can't express yourself, in others' you can't grow a simple plant, in others your money starts being controlled by
higher-ups, and in certain places the monetary system has been abused to keep the powerful in power while everyone else suffers.

Crypto doesn't solve any of this permanently, but it gives the "people" the proof, and the means to fight back should a large enough
collective be formed.

Of course it seems like everyone is looking towards regulation and laws being an end to the "classic crypto ideals", but to me it's an
indicator of who is willing to comply vs who is willing to fight it. Maybe it's because I actually use crypto, and maybe it's because
I actually see that people that are being oppressed use it for "good", or their own good I should say.

I will help them in any way I can, and I will help myself in any way that I can.

Anyways, speaking about crypto; let me write a little bit about my own projects.

## Vulture & Friends
I am still working on Vulture, albeit only when I feel like it. My goal for vulture remains the same, I want it to be a crypto wallet that
I personally want to use over other wallets. I want it to be available on all platforms (looking at the Solana Saga very curiously right now).

Soo, there is a way to go, but I have more than one project and I won't force myself to only work on one. It's an open-source project for the common good.

But hey, there's quite a lot there. I've been working on other things but those come later. I've learnt to probably only announce
things once I've 100% confirmed their readiness.

## Work and other projects
I've found some work at a crypto company in the end of 2022, and still going! And I like it, mostly because I am learning a lot of things
with the project that I've chosen to work on. I believe that I've done good work, and I've gotten to work with languages all over the place.
Example being using Rust to create native libraries for use in other languages and applications. Fun stuff, and importantly: useful stuff.

This work is helpful indeed with the plans I have in mind; they might fail, regardless it's the journey that will be
the interesting fun part, I just hope I get to travel more and meet more new people this year, or meet new people that I like rather.

It's a bit of an uncommon occurrance for me, but that's as much as I'm going to write about that.

## Looking deep into nature
I don't believe in the "humanity is straying far from nature" philosophy that has seem to grow since the industrial revolution. We are nature,
and everything we create is an "extension" of nature. Whether it's biological or not I don't see the significance in. Everything is still just
atoms, particles and waves. Our extension of nature might be an extension of us, rather. I could write quite a lot about this, but I think
I'm getting my point across.

Much how some plants are natural organic bio-chemists to wonderful molecules, we humans can create and engineer things.

This doesn't mean that I don't believe that we have been quite destructive to "other" nature, but of course this just means that we've been
destructive to ourselves.

I often say that one of my goals is to look as deep into nature as I can, especially on days where I need it; and in this goal is also seeing
myself as part of it and the rest of the world.

I've taken an odd path very early on in my life that has been quite lonely and desolate, not seeking any pity at all; in fact at the beginning of this year I
thought: *why should I stop here?*, I'm not going to stop and I'm going to continue, or so I've decided.

## Playing & Coping
I like playing, I like going to the forest imagining a world with magic and wonder, climbing trees and playing the flute alone where there is no
one but me and the rest of the forest.

Being able to disconnect, sometimes by choice and sometimes not by a conscious choice can be bad, and it has and can lead to mania; but
I've accepted that this is part of how my mind works.

This is another topic that I could write about a lot, so I'll save it for now. But this is something that I'll try to maximize more, and
stop supressing just because of other external factors.

## Undervalued
I have learnt that finding work at an early age is difficult, maybe it's because age corresponds to knowledge and experience a lot of the times;
but I've recently learnt that I should try to not undersell myself, I have a *lot* of experience and I learn extremely quickly. I always have
a passion for these things.

It doesn't help that I look and sound very young, but if someone instantly disagrees or recoils because of those facts then at least I know who
to avoid. Luckily, those people tend to become rarer and rarer, at least I like to believe that that's true.

## Hope
I will make sure to cultivate a very hopeful and forward-looking, yet present-minded mind this year. This is my goal, as I believe it will
be very useful. I believe that it might suit the way my brain just happens to work well, I've tried a lot of different philosophies and so
far I thing this one will suit me well, but we'll see.

There are gut-wrenching moments where I think about something, or maybe missunderstand some occurance that causes extreme sadness and/or anxiety;
whatever it may be, it's normal, it's just the mania that tends to be a bit more extreme for me.

This is why emotional catharsis is extremely important, it is crucial for my own survival and it also means that I can take inspiration
from experiences and emotions and transduce them into something physical; something that I other others can appreciate one day.

Anyways, as of writing this right now; there's a lot of chaos in my mind, this happens every-other week for me. I'll call it on this writing.

I plan on making lots of music, I like to stream sometimes as well, so I will try to do that as
well. It's fun, and I don't have many expectations other than how much I'll enjoy the activities.

## Conclusion
Whenever it feels as if I'm being *metaphorically* stabbed in the gut with a knife I instantly rush to different ways to deal with the situation,
as opposed to before where I find ways to cope.

Of course, dealing with the situation should be more constructive in the future rather than destructive, even though it might be temporarily
destructive in the moment, lots of trial and error...

Anyhow, maybe I'll write more about specific topics and experiences in the future...

Bye bye, ghosts of the internet...
