# Imp Works
A couple years ago, ~3 years to be exact, I created the kayowo.net website. It was a website where I posted some blogs, as well as some information about the projects I was working on; mainly game dev projects.

I was mainly an indie dev at the time I suppose, cryptography & web 3.0 was interesting to me but I prefered the art of game development, so much goes into game dev; the code, the 3D/2D art, the music, the game design/idea, etc. I love creating games and will probably continue.

But three years later and a lot has changed, I've decided to keep kayowo related to game development, and instead have this new website I created be my blog, as well as a collection of my art. I've also made a page dedicated to displaying some of the projects I'm involved with, such as [xavax.io](https://xavax.io).

## The code
When I first created the kayowo.net website, and when I updated it to use my own code completely instead of wordpress I wrote a log dedicated to me just nerding out about the code & design of it all, I really like building pretty things; the back-end code has to be elegant, but so does the UI/UX, it's an art of its own.

Anyways, this website is actually really cool, it makes writing logs and stuff a lot easier!

I use Vue as a front-end framework, it makes designing reactive & neat looking websites a lot more fun! I like vue because it's easier to build truly reactive websites and webapps, even compared to react *imo*. It's also less of a shit-show to read other peoples vue projects than it is with angular. Vue > angular > react is how I would react the three main web front-end frameworks!

All the logs are hosted on a server, written in the markdown format! The webapp then fetches the logs, filters them, and displays them!

I'm not using any themes, all of the UI is designed by me, I feel like the style becomes more personal that way.

```rust
fn syntax_highlighting() {
    let text: string = "Even the syntax highlighting is custom, It uses the same color pallete that I like to use with code editors..."
    println!("{}", text);
}
```

## Artwork
The [artworks](artworks.imp.works) page, or subdomain really, is a collection of some of the art I've made. I lose my mind really quickly if I don't express my state of consciousness in anyway, so I create things; it's basically the reason I even made this website in the first place.

I create lots of music, most of it is very psychedelic in nature since I like to experiment with synths and just generate sounds that sound absolutely insane, especially if your in an unusual conscious state.

## Projects
The [projects](projects.imp.works) page is just a collection of the projects that I'm involved with, nothing more nothing less...

## Outro
Anyhow, I feel like this first introduction log explains this new website in a fairly neat way! I'll keep all my older logs in kayowo.net for historical purposes I suppose...

I have this habit of deleting my old shit because it's just annoying looking back, but I've forced myself to not do that.

Bye~
