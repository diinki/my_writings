# End of 2023

I WRITE SO RARELY!!!
(this is very untrue, I write a lot, I just tend to not publish anything...)

I've made a new updated website now! As you can see... And so I've decided
to also write a new blog, especially since I have had a tradition of writing
something by each EOY.

A lot has happened this year, both personally as well as externally in the
world; lots of things have happened that mean a lot to me as well as other
people.

It was a weird year, I turned 20 which was a bit weird as well, considering
how not-different I feel compared to previous time... Idk where the modern
notions of becoming older stem from, I've officially left teenhood though!

Most people would likely miss their teenage years but personally, I want to stay
as far as I possibly can from those years; even though they did shape me.

## New website

Fourth official edition of my personal website!! I've added some legacy blogs that
I wrote a few years ago as well, even tho it's kinda painful re-visiting them.

This one is written with typescript/react, designed by myself n everything from
scratch; not much to say, still quite WIP actually... feel free 2 have a look around!

For this iteration I've decided to create a calm, lush, retro theme. I want it to be
simple, yet not afraid of being detailed in the right places. Most details will be
added in later updates though...

I'll be honest, so far I really like this UI/UX, it does lack some personality, but
this will all be added and improved upon in the future.

## Writing tendencies

One interesting thing with writing blogs so rarely is seeing how my writing changes
so dramatically between each blog,
my thoughts become more difficult to sort as time passes; especially these days...

And I think for personal/general blogs such as these I won't think too much about
editing and writing properly, although I'll try!

My blogs from early 2023/2022 were mostly technical in nature as I explore some
areas of technology, I'm still there mentally but I've decided to take a more
artistic approach to the things I do, and not suppress them in favor of appealing
to certain clients that would hire me for my code; I don't care about that anymore!

I'll always edit more technical blogs more though, since I'm trying to convey something very specific and objective...

I've learned that I'm well within my capabilities in terms of being in the developer/coder/software-engineer field, more so than most; I don't want
to work with anyone that minds the way I naturally behave :p

## Music, Content, Art

For the first time, I've taken a little more attention to actually publishing some
of the art that I make, I'm not sure what took me so long, I've always been opposed
to publishing things, maybe because I was so attached to the ideas of finally
dying with all of my ideas.

I constantly encounter times where I feel as if I just really, really would like
to perish, not in a sad and depressing way though, but as in, I really feel like
human life isn't for me... All the shit people talk about, obsess about, relate to,
or do, I just feel so alienated from all of it... This is nothing new, but
since 2022, and just up until recently in 2023 I've learned to deal with it in
other ways.

I've been able to talk to some people that are also slightly odd, I've also been
able to find a nice new home in my consciousness that isn't so harmful, it
actually protects me quite well...

I've managed to "close" the opened chapters that previous annoying psychedelic
experiences have introduced, ironically with the slight assistance of more
psychedelic experiences; some of which didn't even include any psychedelics...

I'm still on the same path I've always been on, but perhaps this peace that I
am feeling stems from letting go and accepting certain things about human
life; I still dislike them, but that doesn't stop me from accepting them...

With some of my creations I've received some feedback actually, I didn't know
that there would be other people interested in some of them, but I suppose I
was wrong; honestly I don't really care that much for it, but it was lovely
nonetheless...

There's a lot that I want to create, and now that I've published more of it
even though it's tiny in comparison to the shit that I've done,
I've felt the itch to create things more and more, so I'll continue posting.

## 256E - 512C & the Neurons

The ever-growing second voice only tries to help me by creating meaning, this
saves me from apathy which is my worst enemy. Apathy is the lowest state
of consciousness for me.

I fear the idea of a growing sense of apathy for the things I love, but I am lucky that it
has been going in the opposite direction, and I have the ever-present, growing,
second voice to thank for that.

I see no point in chasing money with lucrative job positions, so many of which
I've been offered, it's tempting, they do give me the tools to continue my personal
creation; maybe I can one day find something that suits both parties, but for now
I think I'll stick to my own circle that I've found myself in.

## DIINKI | RAKETA

For my music, I will indeed start publishing some of it, I'll just use
[diinki](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1B7CulxLR4rOjwI8ods1dy?si=SbYqPaKYQaClsJ948tpIww), but with a flipped 'N'.

Yes, I know that it's an 'i' in cyrillic, that doesn't matter, I just think it looks
cool :p

RAKETA is an EP that I'll be working on and releasing, it's nothing too ambitious, but it's the start to the project and it does inherit some
meaning.

I focus a lot on audio-visuals as well as stories. It's more to me than just a product.

This start will give me the keys to continue doing things.

I've been offered to publish some psytrance tracks on a label that I personally once
sought after but, I've decided to stick to self publishing of everything for now...

I don't want to only stick to psytrance either, it's all about the energies that I
want to express at certain moments of time, or messages that I want to convey.

## 2024

2024 is such a nice fucking number, I swear everyone better do it justice and I
don't mean in a "2024 calamity" or "2024 world war" kind of way...

"2024 AI revolution" would sound pretty cool tho, and could be acceptable depending
on the outcome...

Personally, for the first time in fucking ever, I don't really have any need to section
off 2023 as it's separate chapter, and start 2024 with new ideas; these years just
flow into each-other and 2024/2023 are just labels.

I still have the same weird feeling I always have near EOY times; but I believe
for different reasons, although I can't figure out why... Maybe it's just a weird
brain thing I have, quite a few of those anyways lole...
