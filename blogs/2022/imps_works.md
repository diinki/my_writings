# Imp's Works

Hello! As of publishing this first blog, this new website of mine is finally up!
It's a web-app that I made which is sort of a continuation of my blogs at [kayowo.net](https://kayowo.net);

Kayowo is my game-dev project, but since I already had the website I also added a blog to it, it has way
more blogs than this website atm; since it's been a thing for longer, but I will reserve kayowo.net to only
have game-dev & game-dev project related content from now imp.works is now my true personal website!

This place will contain my writings, a collections of the projects I'm involved with, and some of my more
artistic creations!

Everytime I create something new, such as this website; I tend to write about the tech behind itself, I did
that with kayowo, so I'll do it with this website as well! _Its really different_

## Non static web-apps

This website isn't a statically generated website (which essentially means that all files are already generated,
and simply served by the web server). It's instead a web-app that fetches information (such as blogs) and displays
them in "real-time".

This has slightly higher network & computation constraints, but allows me to do lots of stupid things in the future...

I chose to not create everything from scratch like I did with the kayowo website, and instead use the Vue 3 front-end
framework. Along with Vue, I use a markdown parser to parse markdown to HTML (that way I can write logs in markdown).

And ontop of all that, I've made my own design & theming! All art here is my own, including the cozy 3D render in the
background... It's one of my personal favorites despite the fact that I made it ~3 years ago, I just love the atmosphere...

</p>

Markdown also comes with all the neat things you'd expect such as syntax highlighting:

```rust
pub fn useful(name: String) {
    let name: String = "the syntax highlighting is also themed :D"
    .to_string();
}
```

I'm now ready to create `technical` papers as well B)

All that being said, the website is still really early, has lots of things that I want to improve; this includes the layout/design/etc...

## Projects

I've been working on lots of projects recently, xavax.io, the multi-chain vulture wallet, as well as some personal game-dev related projects!

I want to focus on creating useful things not just for myself, but to many other people this year _2022 :p_.

With all that said 'n' done, I think I'll just continue doing whatever and seeing whatever happens, no big plans; just going to build stuff... And write more now that I've made this place, my next writing will probably have lots to do with conscious states & psychedelics, ganna be fun!

## End

Web 3.0 is all about decentralization _imo_, decentralize the financial system, decentralize the addition, removal & editing of laws, decentralize companies (internally), and create tools & interfaces which allow anyone to interact with these systems; make it extremely difficult for authoritarianism to grow.

Preservation of **the** individual is extremely important, hopefully I'll have enough time to write about that.

Cya~
