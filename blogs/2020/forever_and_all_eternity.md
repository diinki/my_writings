# Forever and all eternity

I write these mostly once every season, all I’m really doing is building a digital ghost
that may live on a bit longer than myself, there are many issues and problems that exist
that I would like to write about; But that's pointless, I don't believe you can solve these
problems, all you do is
replace them other problem,
sometimes all I do is try to solve every problem that I encounter but end up nowhere...

The good thing about obscurity is that you can freely say whatever you want without any worries
of misinterpretation.

Ones thoughts is just a current conscious state one has in a specific moment
in time, and when one tries to share those thoughts to someone else in the form of language a lot
of meaning becomes lost in translation. It’s essentially transduction of stream-of-consciousness.

I’m not very good with words which
means that anyone who reads this text would maybe have a hard time understanding. But Again, that’s why obscurity
is a good thing, I won’t have to worry about that! Smile.

## Time lead us astray

I run away from time a lot, humans store our memories very linearly, the ability to imagine the memories we
will have in the future fortifies the illusion of linear time.

I really dislike perception of linear time because at the end there is always death, whether you commit suicide
or die in a way that was out of your control, there is always death. No matter how long we may
be able to extend our lives in the future. It's obvious, but for important reasons I have a very big need to
think about in the current time, perhaps because I feel so close to it in the current moment; and that's
writing even about the effects psychedelics have had on me.

So what is the point of any of this anyways? I’ve suppose I've wanted to leave behind a digital ghost, one with art
that expresses my consciousness in some way, I love the process of creation, and the idea of a potential artistic legacy
doesn't sound too bad; even though I don't cater to mainstream formulas by any means.

Many people despise talking about things that are philosophical in nature but I kinda see it as a necessary thing in my
life, I need a perspective, a way of thinking that "justifies" my life, in a weird way. But this comes internally, without
much external input from other people, not that I have had any of that in years anyways; that's what I get for always running
away to the forests lol...

I’m not going to run away from time anymore though, in fact I’ve decided the path that I am going to take. I have always found myself in
my projects and artwork, its the only thing that I can do that doesn’t make me feel alienated and completely alone. It’s all I really
have, I don’t think it will last very long, and this love could end at any moment; so I suppose I should make hay while the sun
still shines.

Each time I’m outside, whether its going to school or just randomly wandering to new places, I observe everything... Everyone is in their
own world, sometimes I get really curious and want to ask someone about their world, but that would just be really inappropriate, that
isn’t really a thing you do over here. I have a bit of a fascination with how other people perceive things, even if they for some
reason perceive me as a terrible person, I would like to understand it.

We observe things from the perspective that our mind has evolved into seeing things from by the function of time, and no matter how much
I try to see things from a different perspective, I am locked into place with my current state of consciousness. Psychedelics can of course change that
in a tremendous way, but again I don’t want to get started on that topic lol. I'm still unsure of how psychedelics have affected me,
in a way I feel as if the "mind expansion" has made me aware of things that I wish I wasn't aware of.

I’ve really gone off on a tangent here, what was this blog even supposed to be about? Ughhh...

## 2021

I haven’t been okay for quite some time, I’m not close to any other person, but I’m still pretty sure that no one is entirely
okay these days, I’ve noticed that I always
get an odd feeling as the year ends, its been the same for the past three years, always the same feeling that is quite difficult to map.

I think it stems from having a moment of time where you can look back and reflect on how everything went and has been going in the past, a new year
is a new section of time we allocate where we can do more stuff, have more plans, create new hope for things… Usually nothing ever becomes of any of those things…

It’s always a "maybe this year is different" or "maybe I’ll change?", But that’s nonsense, nothing happens on its own, things
tend to get worse on their own unless you actively do something about it… I think that this entire thing stems from viewing time as a linear phenomena; I wouldn't care about years otherwise... This isn't something I particularly enjoy ;-;, especially as I get older... _(notgonnatalkaboutpsychedelics)_

I am going to give up in the sense of caring about paths that have been plotted for you by society, or by people. I am going to do my own thing
for the rest of my time, whether it makes me kms next year or not isn’t something I care about. I won’t have any expectations or hope, it's not something that I need anyways, I feel a great amount of **something** out of creating things.

Hope doesn’t do much, I’m not trying to entail that it’s a bad thing; It could tremendously change outcomes of certain
situations, hope gives energy and motivation and those two things are invaluable in times of suffering, but there’s always a come-down with those things, much like psychedelics, I don't really want to write about my experience with mania and unfortunate
delusions in this blog; alas I've generated a lot of hope that stem from those two things, and this has never ended well for me.

If things come to worst, there is always the option of nuking every expectation and just going on a seemingly
random direction, I'm a fan of radical decision making in times of chaos and "sucidalness"! Probably a sentence
that I definitely should leave out of this blog, or maybe include a "as long as it doesn't hurt other people"...

I've received some comments about these blogs in the past and the number one thing I'm told is that I should edit more,
and stop writing like I'm talking to myself in a dark room, but I would rather preserve the "stream of consciousness"
way of writing...

I write way more properly than the way I talk anyways lol, hopefully it won't just devolve into wordsalad in the
future, sometimes I say or write things that I swear had some meaning to them, yet I just can't seem to interpret
anymore.

I don't know...
